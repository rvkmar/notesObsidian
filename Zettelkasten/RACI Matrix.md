## Key to the RACI Matrix
- **R (Responsible)**: The person(s) who perform the task.
- **A (Accountable)**: The person ultimately answerable for the taskâ€™s completion. Only one person can be accountable.
- **C (Consulted)**: Those whose input is sought during the task's completion (two-way communication).
- **I (Informed)**: Those who are kept informed about progress or decisions (one-way communication).

## Observations:
1. **Clear Responsibility Distribution**: Ensures each role understands their part in critical tasks, minimizing overlap.
2. **Alignment with Operational Priorities**: Accountability is placed with senior roles (Director/Joint Directors), while operational tasks are delegated to relevant personnel.
3. **Effective Consultation Channels**: DIETs are consulted for curriculum tasks, ensuring local expertise is utilized.
4. **Communication and Feedback**: Feedback mechanisms and reporting lines ensure smooth coordination between SCERT, DIETs, and district-level officers.

This RACI Matrix improves clarity and minimizes conflict by clearly defining roles across tasks. It ensures accountability at the leadership level while empowering DIETs and lecturers to take ownership of operational activities.
