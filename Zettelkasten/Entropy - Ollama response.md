Explain the concept 'Entropy' to a 5 year old. Give brief, clear answers that include all key details. Be concise but informative.

Imagine you have a toy box full of different colored blocks. When you first open the box, everything is neat and organized, with each block in its own special place. But then, you start playing with the blocks, and they get all mixed up! Some blocks are on top of others, some are on the floor, and some are even outside the box.

That's kind of like what entropy is - it's when things get messy and disorganized. When we do things, like play or move around, we make a mess. And that's okay! But sometimes, we need to clean up the mess so everything can be neat and organized again.

Entropy is also like how things tend to fall apart over time. Like how your favorite toy might get broken if you drop it, or how your clothes might get wrinkly if you don't iron them. It's like the world is always getting a little bit more messy, but that's just part of life!
