> SCERT, Delhi has endeavored to address the issue of Inclusive Education through a set 
of three Manuals - for general teachers, for teachers specializing in special education, 
and for educational administrators. These would help the educators and others 
concerned with education to overcome exclusion through inclusive approaches to 
Education. The manuals are intended to create a positive atmosphere for children's needs which will help all the learners to develop appropriate relationships and prepare them for a useful life in the mainstream.
