> This book will help teachers use the Powerful Task Rubric using an easily digestible format to help them delve into the tool's design components. They'll be able to use technology to complete interactive tasks, and understand first-hand how technology is a critical design component in student task design that brings about more profound and relevant learning. It will also help them to identify opportunities for creating powerful tasks in the areas of engagement, academic strategies, questions, and cognition.
